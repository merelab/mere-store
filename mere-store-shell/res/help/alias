NAME
    alias - create a custom command based on existing one.

SYNOPSIS
    alias [name [command [argument...]]

DESCRIPTION
    The alias command instruct the shell to replace one string with another
    string - the another string usually a command with arguments.
    When we use a single commnad with arguments, that make the command long,
    multiple times, it is convenient to give a short name of the long one.


OPTIONS
    name    - name of the alias
    commnad - name of the commnad
    argument- argument of the command

EXAMPLES
Create a short-cut command named "cs" to create a store
>alias cs create store

To see the defined command for a named alias "cs", run alias with alias name as
argument
>alias cs

Invoking alias with no argument will display all the aliases defined; So to see
all the defined aliases
>alias
